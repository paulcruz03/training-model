# AI Training Pipeline with pgvector and Python

This repository contains Python scripts for training machine learning models and storing embeddings in a PostgreSQL database using the `pgvector` extension. Designed for efficient similarity search and scalable AI applications, this project helps bridge traditional relational databases with modern vector-based AI workflows.

## Features
- Model training and embedding generation
- Seamless PostgreSQL integration via `pgvector`
- Embedding storage and retrieval using SQL
- Example scripts and configuration templates

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn / Transformers)
- PostgreSQL + pgvector
